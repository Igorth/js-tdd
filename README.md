![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/Igorth/js-tdd)

Create simple tests do learn TDD with JavaScript.

The course it is avaiable in [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/js-com-tdd-na-pratica)

## ðŸ–¥ TDD
Node.js | Javascript | Mocha | Chai

## Instructions

First, if you don't have Node.js you'll need to install it:
* You can do a manual install from here: `https://nodejs.org/en/`. This will include Node and its package manager, `npm`.

* If you are on a Mac and using Homebrew you can do the following:
  + `brew install node --without-npm` (`npm` and Homebrew don't play well together)
  + `curl -L https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh` (so, install `npm` separately)

## Once you've got Node installed:
* `git clone git@https://github.com/Igorth/js-tdd`
* `cd js-tdd`
* `yarn` to install dependencies
* `yarn test` to start the tests
* `yarn test` to start the tests
* `yarn test:coverage` to see the coverage about tets
